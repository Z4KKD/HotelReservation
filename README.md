# Hotel Reservation System

This Python program facilitates hotel reservations by allowing users to input arrival and departure dates. It calculates the total cost of the stay based on nightly rates and provides information about the reservation. Additionally, it handles scenarios such as invalid date formats and ensures that the departure date is after the arrival date.

## Example
